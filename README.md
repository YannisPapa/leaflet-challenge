# leaflet-challenge

This is my submission for Module 15 Challenge with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

There are two subfodlers Leaflet-Part-1 and Leaflet-Part-2.

Running index.html (from Leaflet-Part-1) with Live server in VS will give you a a webpage that can be used to display Earthquakes that have occured in the last 7 days, the color and size will changes based on depth and magnitude.
